        Players navigate through diverse battlefield environments, including
        destructible brick walls, impenetrable steel barriers, and natural
        obstacles like water and bushes, which add depth to strategic
        maneuvering. Power-ups scattered across the battlefield enhance
        gameplay, offering upgrades such as increased firepower, shields, and
        explosive attacks.
